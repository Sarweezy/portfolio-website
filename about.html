          <h1>Hello! Thanks for visiting my site.</h1>
          <p>My name is Sarwar Ahmed and I am a Bronx native in New York City. 
             A few years ago, I decided to get out of my comfort zone and start 
             solving coding problems on leetcode and I found it to be really satisfying
             and fun, especially when I was able to solve a problem. I originally studied 
             mechanical engineering in college but I found myself becoming more passionate 
             in the field of computer science. Then, I decided to learn more about data structures
             and algorithms through online resources and practiced what I learned on leetcode 
             problems. Next, with the help of my peers, I started to practice developing websites 
             and mobile applications and found myself even more passionate about the field. In the end,
             I hope to build a career as a full-stack developer and become profiecient enough
             to teach others who like me, may not have a computer science degree but find themselves
             passionate about technology and computer science.
